# SentimentAnalysis 
.In this project i used data set of Movie Reviews.     
.The data is cleaned and checked for null values. 
.Then i imported libraries and dataset is loaded.  
.Then the data is PreProccessed such that only meaningful words remain.such that processed texts are extracted.  
.The processed texts are converted to numeric values.   
.Then the data is divided into four parts i.e. x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test using sklearn library.  
.Then model is trained using Guassian Naive Bayes, DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier.    
.The Accuracy is checked and compared for the above mentioned algorithms.  
.Among the algorithms,RandomForest gave the best Accuracy i.e 82% which is decent.
